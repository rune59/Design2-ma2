                        this website is designed to show
                        different choices that are essential for good web design.

                        The task is to create a website for home decor.

                        In this delivery, color selection and analysis of colors and
                        textures have a particular focus.

                        Further down you can see some examples of interior decoration in the home.

                            there is a window with a beautiful view. The colors are pleasant and calm.

                <h1 class="heading-title">Some words about good design</h1>
                <p>
                    Design is not an exact science, in the sense that you cannot always say that something is bad or
                    good. But sometimes you
                    can do it more than other times. </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The human eye searches for harmony and symmetry. Balance can be another word for symmetry. </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Colors on a website are about psychology. Psychology is not an exact science either, but we have to
                    deal with it
                    nonetheless, because emotions are awakened by colors, and we often wish that the person looking at
                    the website should
                    feel what we want them to feel. In this sense, you can say that color selection is about
                    manipulation. </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    One often distinguishes between "warm" and "cold" colors. </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Brown is a natural color, which is associated with relaxation, endurance, reliability, confidence,
                    warmth, comfort,
                    safety, and it is considered to be conventional and sometimes sophisticated.
                    These are key words that I feel fit in well for a website that will be about interiors. </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I present three examples of interiors. These are framed in a greyscale frame. This has been done
                    deliberately because
                    gray tends to be a neutral color, preferably a bit conservative, but also because the message is
                    serious.
                    <br>
                <p>
                    I have used white color as background for the decor examples. White symbolizes simplicity and
                    purity. Simplicity I feel
                    harmonizes well with the principle "keep it simple". The links in the menu alternate between white
                    and black, depending
                    on whether the status is "hover" or not.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The basic color in the logo is brown, surrounded by a lighter part with the light brown text "Home
                    decoration", and it
                    harmonizes well with the fact that brown and shades of brown have been chosen for the entire
                    website. The H1 headings
                    are also in light brown, on a light background. </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    As a principle, a color on a web page should be used on more than one element. This principle has
                    been applied to this
                    website. It gives an impression of visual consistency and predictability. Safety in a way.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I have used "shades and tints of brown". It can be difficult to make a strict distinction between
                    brown and
                    orange. But both
                    colors have a lot in common. They are both two warm colors. They symbolize kindness and optimism.
                    I have used both "shades" and "tints" of brown. Mostly "shades" in the menu and footer. And mostly
                    "tints" in the decor
                    examples.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I use an analogous color scheme. Colors that stand next to each other in the color wheel. The
                    purpose is to create
                    mutual harmony between the various sections on the website. I feel that a monochromatic color scheme
                    would create too
                    little contrast. It becomes a bit too minimalistic in this context. I use an analogous color scheme
                    to create the same
                    undertone for the entire website. If I were to use complementary colors, I feel the tension would be
                    stronger. A home
                    should be a place where there is harmony, not both heat and cold. By using split complementary
                    colours, the tension
                    would be reduced, but I feel that this tension is also unnecessarily large in this context. A
                    triadic color scheme could
                    perhaps have been an alternative, but again consideration for calm, warmth and harmony in the home
                    wins. </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I have not used textures on the page. Or possibly you could call the grid in the logo textures. Nor
                    have I felt the need
                    to highlight any section of the website over others.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In the lesson, it is said that "shapes" can bring "interesting effects" to a website. But nothing is
                    said about what is
                    interesting and how the effect may be perceived by people. There can be very individual perceptions
                    of what an effect of
                    something is like. In any case, I feel that it will be excessively experimental to try this. </p>

                <p>
                    It is a general principle in web development to keep things simple.
                    This should also apply to color choices. In a way, it is made easy for the user if he only needs to
                    deal with a limited
                    number of colours.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I have created a simple logo with inspiration from this website:

                    I have made some changes and customization.

                <br />
                <p>
                    I got inspiration for the color choice here:

                    It seems that brown is a popular color when it comes to interiors, see

                    <br />
                </p>
                <p class="italic"> «Brown was a memorable part of both 2000s and 1970s decor, and now
                    similar
                    influences are helping bring the color back. Like the 2000s, the shift toward warmer colors comes,
                    in part, because we’re responding to the prolonged uncertainty of the pandemic by incorporating more
                    comforting colors into our homes”.

                    Jessica Bennett recently wrote an article

                </p>
                <p>This may indicate that brown as a basic color is about to have a renaissance in interior design.</p>
                <br />

                    Jessica Bennett writes, among other things, that natural earth colors are on the rise as a trend:
                </p>
                <p class="italic">“5. Rich Earth Tones
                    Vroom foresees kitchen color trends transitioning from softer whites and blues and toward warm,
                    grounded hues like
                    terra-cotta, blush, and even plum. "The beachy or farmhouse color palettes are taking a step back,
                    and those rich earthy
                    tones are stepping up," she says. You can also expect to see more natural wood cabinetry in kitchens
                    as homeowners
                    embrace the texture and color inherent in the wood”.
                </p>
                <h2>Textures must have a purpose...</h2>
                <p>
                    ...and, to be honest, I haven't found any element where texture would have any positive effect.
                    Possibly a negative
                    effect. As a distraction. As an opponent of the "keep it simple" principle. I am open minded to
                    suggestions that indicate I am wrong.<br />
